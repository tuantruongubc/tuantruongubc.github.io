Going further back in time, I was a graduate of the High School for Gifted Students (Hanoi University of Science) and a Maths Olympian (bronze medal 🥉, IMO 2018)</p> <p>My research focuses on foundational Machine Learning where I particularly focus on <em>Transfer learning</em> and <em>Learning theory</em>. I’ve explored various topics such as the applications of <strong>Approximate Bayesian Inference</strong> and <strong>Mixture of Experts</strong> to <strong>Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT)</strong>. I have also explored other topics in machine learning such as <strong>Geometric Deep Learning, Optimization Theory</strong> and their applications to make foundational model more efficient and robust. I’m always curious and eager to learn about new ideas and explore diverse topics.</p> </body></html>
