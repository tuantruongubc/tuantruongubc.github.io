  abstract={We introduce Flat Hilbert Bayesian Inference (FHBI), an algorithm designed to enhance generalization in Bayesian inference. Our approach involves an iterative two-step procedure with an adversarial functional perturbation step and a functional descent step within the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. This methodology is supported by a theoretical analysis that extends previous findings on generalization ability from finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces to infinite-dimensional functional spaces. To evaluate the effectiveness of FHBI, we conduct comprehensive comparisons against nine baseline methods on the VTAB-1K benchmark, which encompasses 19 diverse datasets across various domains with diverse semantics. Empirical results demonstrate that FHBI consistently outperforms the baselines by notable margins, highlighting its practical efficacy.},

  journal={International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)},  
  abstract={Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a powerful and efficient method for fine-tuning large-scale foundation models. Despite its popularity, the theoretical understanding of LoRA has remained underexplored. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis of LoRA by examining its connection to the Mixture of Experts models. Under this framework, we show that a simple technique, reparameterizing LoRA matrices, can notably accelerate the low-rank matrix estimation process. In particular, we prove that reparameterization can reduce the data needed to achieve a desired estimation error from an exponential to a polynomial scale. Motivated by this insight, we propose **Rep**arameterized **Lo**w-**R**ank **A**daptation (RepLoRA), incorporating a lightweight MLP to reparameterize the LoRA matrices. Extensive experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that RepLoRA consistently outperforms vanilla LoRA. With limited data, RepLoRA surpasses LoRA by a substantial margin of up to **40.0%** and achieves LoRA's performance using only **30.0%** of the training data, highlighting the theoretical and empirical robustness of our PEFT method.},

  journal={International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)},  
  abstract={We introduce Interactive Bayesian Distributional Robustness (IBDR), a novel Bayesian inference framework that allows modeling the interactions between particles, thereby enhancing ensemble quality through increased particle diversity. IBDR is grounded in a generalized theoretical framework that connects the distributional population loss with the approximate posterior, motivating a practical dual optimization procedure that enforces distributional robustness while fostering particle diversity. We evaluate IBDR's performance against various baseline methods using the VTAB-1K benchmark and the common reasoning language task. The results consistently show that IBDR outperforms these baselines, underscoring its effectiveness in real-world applications.},

  abstract={Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has attracted significant attention for its effectiveness in improving generalization across various tasks. However, its underlying principles remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze SAM’s training dynamics using the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness and propose a third-order stochastic differential equation (SDE), which reveals that the dynamics are driven by a complex mixture of second- and third-order terms. We show that alignment between the perturbation vector and the top eigenvector is crucial for SAM’s effectiveness in regularizing sharpness, but find that this alignment is often inadequate in practice, which limits SAM's efficiency. Building on these insights, we introduce Eigen-SAM, an algorithm that explicitly aims to regularize the top Hessian eigenvalue by aligning the perturbation vector with the leading eigenvector. We validate the effectiveness of our theory and the practical advantages of our proposed approach through comprehensive experiments. Code is available at https://github.com/RitianLuo/EigenSAM.},

  abstract = {We introduce Monte Carlo Forest Search (MCFS), a class of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for learning policies in tree MDPs, for which policy execution involves traversing an exponential-sized tree. Examples of such problems include proving unsatisfiability of a SAT formula; counting the number of solutions of a satisfiable SAT formula; and finding the optimal solution to a mixed-integer program. MCFS algorithms can be seen as extensions of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to cases where, rather than finding a good path (solution) within a tree, the problem is to find a small tree within a forest of candidate trees. We instantiate and evaluate our ideas in an algorithm that we dub Knuth Synthesis, an MCFS algorithm that learns DPLL branching policies for solving the Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem, with the objective of achieving good average-case performance on a given distribution of unsatisfiable problem instances. Knuth Synthesis is the first RL approach to avoid the prohibitive costs of policy evaluations in an exponentially-sized tree, leveraging two key ideas: first, we estimate tree size by randomly sampling paths and measuring their lengths, drawing on an unbiased approximation due to Knuth (1975); second, we query a strong solver at a user-defined depth rather than learning a policy across the whole tree, to focus our policy search on early decisions that offer the greatest potential for reducing tree size. We matched or exceeded the performance of a strong baseline on three well-known SAT distributions, facing problems that were two orders of magnitude more challenging than those addressed in previous RL studies.},
