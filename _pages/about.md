Hi! I'm Tuan Truong ‚Äî but you can call me Tuna üêü.

I'm currently a Machine Learning Research Resident at [Qualcomm AI Research](https://www.qualcomm.com/research), where I work under the supervision of Professors [Tan Nguyen](https://tanmnguyen89.github.io/) and [Dinh Phung](https://tanmnguyen89.github.io/). My research interests lie in the foundations of machine learning, with a particular focus on **transfer learning** and **learning theory**.

Previously, I was a Machine Learning Research Resident at [VinAI](https://www.vinai.io/), working with Professor [Trung Le](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/trung-le). In 2024, I earned a Combined Honours degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/). During my time here, I also worked as a research assistant under the supervision of Professo [Kevin Leyton-Brown](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~kevinlb/index.html). Before all that, I was also a math Olympian ‚Äî winning a bronze medal ü•â at the [International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) 2018](https://www.imo-official.org/).
