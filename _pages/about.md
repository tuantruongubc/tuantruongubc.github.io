<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->


Hi, I'm Tuan Truong, you can call me Tuna üêü

I was a graduate üéì of the [**University of British Columbia**](https://www.ubc.ca/), and is currently a Machine Learning Research Resident ü§ñ at [**VinAI Research**](https://vinai.io), where I am working under the supervision of [**Prof. Trung Le**](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/trung-le) üèõÔ∏è. Going further back in time, I was a graduate of the High School for Gifted Students (Hanoi University of Science) and a Maths Olympian (bronze medal ü•â, IMO 2018)

My research focuses on foundational Machine Learning where I particularly focus on *Transfer learning* and *Learning theory*. I‚Äôve explored various topics such as the applications of **Approximate Bayesian Inference** and **Mixture of Experts** to **Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT)**. I have also explored other topics in machine learning such as **Geometric Deep Learning, Optimization Theory** and their applications to make foundational model more efficient and robust. I‚Äôm always curious and eager to learn about new ideas and explore diverse topics!

> I‚Äôm actively seeking PhD positions in Computer Science for the upcoming academic year üîç
