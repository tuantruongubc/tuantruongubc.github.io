Hi, I'm a CS Ph.D. student at UCLA under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://baharanm.github.io/">Baharan Mirzasoleiman</a>. My research focuses on improving data quality to enhance the performance and efficiency of large (vision-)language models. Specifically, I work on **synthetic data generation** and **data selection** to optimize training, making these models more effective and accessible.

Before joining UCLA, I was an AI Resident at <a href="https://www.vinai.io/">VinAI</a>. Prior to that, I received my BS degree, summa cum laude, from Toyo University. Going further back in time, I was a graduate of High School for Gifted Students (Hanoi University of Science) and a Maths Olympian (silver medal, IMO 2015).
