Hi, I'm Tuan Truong, you can call me Tuna 🐟

I was a graduate 🎓 of the [**University of British Columbia**](https://www.ubc.ca/), and is currently a Machine Learning Research Resident 🤖 at [**VinAI Research**](https://vinai.io), where I am working under the supervision of [**Prof. Trung Le**](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/trung-le) 🏛️. Going further back in time, I was a graduate of the High School for Gifted Students (Hanoi University of Science) and a Maths Olympian (bronze medal 🥉, IMO 2018)

My research focuses on foundational Machine Learning where my main goal is making foundational models **Scalable & Efficient**. I’ve explored various topics such as the applications of **Approximate Bayesian Inference** and **Mixture of Experts** to **Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT)**. I have also explored other topics in machine learning such as **Geometric Deep Learning, Optimization Theory** and their applications to make foundational model more efficient and robust. I’m always curious and eager to learn about new ideas and explore diverse topics!
